IN R
 We wil build and train the deep neural network using the College dataset, and it contains statistics for a large number of US colleges, collected from the 1995 issue of US News and World Report. This dataset was taken from the StatLib library, which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University, and was used in the ASA Section on Statistical Graphics. 
 
 Private: A factor with levels No and Yes indicating private or public university 
 Apps: Number of applications received
 Accept: Number of applications accepted 
 Enroll: Number of new students enrolled 
 Top10perc: Percentage of new students from top 10 percent of H.S. class 
 Top25perc: Percentage of new students from top 25 percent of H.S. class 
 F.Undergrad: Number of full time undergraduates 
 P.Undergrad: Number of part time undergraduates 
 Outstate: Out-of-state tuition 
 Room.Board: Room and board costs 
 Books: Estimated book costs 
 Personal: Estimated personal spending 
 PhD: Percentage of faculty with Ph.D.s
 Terminal: Percentage of faculty with terminal degree
S.F.Ratio: Student-faculty ratio 
perc.alumni: Percentage of alumni who donate 
Expend: Instructional expenditure per student 
Grad.Rate: Graduation rate

Our aim will be to build a multilayer neural network capable of predicting whether the school is public or private.
